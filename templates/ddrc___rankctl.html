<tr valign=top><td>max_rank_rd</td><td class="center"> 3:0</td><td class="tooltip">rw<span class="tooltiptext">Normal read/write</span></td><td class="hex">0xF</td><td>Background: Reads to the same rank can be performed back-to-back. Reads to different ranks require additional gap dictated by the register RANKCTL.diff_rank_rd_gap. This is to avoid possible data bus contention as well as to give PHY enough time to switch the delay when changing ranks. The DDRC arbitrates for bus access on a cycle-by-cycle basis; therefore after a read is scheduled, there are few clock cycles (determined by the value on RANKCTL.diff_rank_rd_gap register) in which only reads from the same rank are eligible to be scheduled. This prevents reads from other ranks from having fair access to the data bus.<br/>This parameter represents the maximum number of reads that can be scheduled consecutively to the same rank. After this number is reached, a delay equal to RANKCTL.diff_rank_rd_gap is inserted by the scheduler to allow all ranks a fair opportunity to be scheduled. Higher numbers increase bandwidth utilization, lower numbers increase fairness.<br/>This feature can be DISABLED by setting this register to 0. When set to 0, the Controller will stay on the same rank as long as commands are available for it.<br/>Minimum programmable value is 0 (feature disabled) and maximum programmable value is 0xF.<br/>FOR PERFORMANCE ONLY.</td></tr>
