Asynchronous interrupt is effective when DAT[1] interrupt is used in 4-bit SD mode (and zero is set to Interrupt Pin Select in the Shared Bus Control register). If this bit is set to 1, the Host Driver can stop the SDCLK during asynchronous interrupt period to save power. During this period, the Host Controller continues to deliver Card Interrupt to the host when it is asserted by the Card.'0' Disabled'1' Enabled</td></tr>

Writing 1 to this bit is meaningless and ignored. Setting 1 means that tuning is completed successfully and setting 0 means that tuning is failed.
