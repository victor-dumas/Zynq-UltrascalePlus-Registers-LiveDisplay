It is cleared by resetting the SD card interrupt factor. In 1-bit mode, the HC shall detect the Card Interrupt without SD Clock to support wakeup. In 4-bit mode, the card interrupt signal is sampled during the interrupt cycle, so there are some sample delays between the interrupt signal from the card and the interrupt to theHost system.<br/>when this status has been set and the HD needs to start this interrupt service, Card Interrupt Status Enable in the Normal Interrupt Status register shall be set to 0 in order to clear the card interrupt statuses latched in the HC and stop driving the Host System. After completion of the card interrupt service (the reset factor in the SD card and the interrupt signal may not be asserted), set Card Interrupt Status Enable to 1 and start sampling the interrupt signal again.<br/>Interrupt detected by DAT[1] is supported<br/>when there is a card per slot. In case of shared bus, interrupt pins are used to detect interrupts. If 000b is set to Interrupt Pin Select in the Shared Bus Control register, this status is effective. Non-zero value is set to Interrupt Pin Select, INT_A, INT_B or INT_C is then used to device interrupts.<br/>Card Interrupt:<br/>0: inactive.<br/>1: active.</td></tr>
