When the memory width given in the DEVID register is greater than 32 bits, multiple reads to this register must be performed together to read a full memory width of data. For example, if the memory width is 128 bits, then reads from this register must be performed four at a time. When a full memory width of data has been read, the RAM Read Pointer is incremented to the next memory word.When no data is available, this register returns 0xFFFFFFFF. This value is chosen because it cannot be generated as part of the trace data when the formatter is enabled.Trace Capture disabled: When in Disabled state (TraceCaptEn=0 and TMCReady=1), the TMC mode is ignored. Reading this register returns the contents of the Local RAM buffer or AXI memory at the location addressed by the RAM Read Pointer Register.Circular Buffer mode: When in Stopped state in Circular Buffer mode and the buffer is not empty, reading this register returns the next word of data from the trace buffer. When all of the trace buffer has been read, the Empty bit in the STS Register is set, and more reads return 0xFFFFFFF. Reading this register when not in Stopped state returns 0xFFFFFFFF.Software FIFO mode: Reading this register returns data from the FIFO. If this register is read when the FIFO is empty, the data returned is 0xFFFFFFFF.Hardware FIFO mode: Reading this register returns 0xFFFFFFFF.Reading this register alters the internal state of the TMC, and can only be performed if the device is unlocked. Reading this register when the device is locked returns 0xFFFFFFFF.In the ETR configuration, when the MemErr bit in the STS Register is set, reading this register returns an error response on the APB slave interface.</td></tr>

For example, for 64_bit wide trace memory and 128_bit wide trace memory, the four LSBs must be 0s. For 256_bit wide trace memory, the five LSBs must be 0s. The width of the trace memory can be obtained by reading the MEMWIDTH field in the DEVID Register, 0xFC8. When one complete buffer or FIFO entry has been read through the RRD Register, the RAM Read Pointer Register is incremented by the number of bytes per memory width of data. For example, for 64_bit wide memory, it is incremented by eight. For 128_bit wide memory, it is incremented by 16 for every complete memory entry read. When the RAM Read Pointer is incremented after having reached its maximum value, it wraps around. The width of this register in the ETB or ETF configurations is log2(MEM_SIZE*4). In the ETR configuration, this register is 32 bits wide, and the contents of this register represents the lower 32 bits of the 40-bit AXI address used to access trace memory. If scatter-gather operation is enabled, this register represents the next address in trace memory to be read, not the address of a page table entry. When in Disabled state (TraceCaptEn=0 and TMCReady=1), a write to this register sets the value of the trace memory address from which data is fetched on a subsequent RRD read. A write to this register when not in Disabled state results in Unpredictable behavior. This register can be read:&lt;ul>&lt;li>when in Disabled state&lt;/li>&lt;li>when in Stopped state (TraceCaptEn=1 and TMCReady=1), in Circular Buffer mode&lt;/li>&lt;li>when in Running (TraceCaptEn=1 and TMCReady=0), Stopping or Stopped states, in Software FIFO mode.&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>When entering Disabled state in Circular Buffer mode with scatter-gather mode disabled, this register points to the next location in the trace buffer to be read. This is for backwards compatibility purposes, so that the buffer can be read while in Disabled state. It is recommended that you read the buffer contents while in Stopped state instead, because the pointers are managed automatically.</td></tr>

The width of the trace memory can be obtained by reading the MEMWIDTH field in the DEVID Register, 0xFC8. Reading this register returns the current memory location being referenced, to which the next write would occur. When one complete buffer or FIFO entry has been written to the RWD Register, the RAM Write Pointer Register is incremented by the number of bytes per memory width of data. For example, for 64_bit wide memory, it is incremented by eight. For 128_bit wide memory it is incremented by 16 for every complete memory entry write. When this register wraps around its maximum value, the Full flag in the Status Register, STS, 0x00C, is set. In the ETB or ETF configurations, the width of this register is log2(MEM_SIZE*4). In the ETR configuration, this register is 32 bits wide, and the contents of this register represent the lower 32 bits of the 40-bit AXI address used to access trace memory. In ETB and ETF configurations, when in Circular Buffer mode, this register can be used to set the address to start capturing data from. This is for backwards compatibility purposes, to enable the FULL signal to be generated before the buffer becomes full. In other configurations and modes, the RAM Write Pointer is reset to the start of trace memory when exiting Disabled state (TraceCaptEn=0 and TMCReady=1).

On capturing the specified number of datawords, a Trigger Event is said to have occurred. The effect of a Trigger Event on TMC behavior is controlled by the FFCR register, 0x304.The number of 32_bit words written into the Trace RAM following the trigger is the value stored in this register+1. This counter is disabled when the TMC is in Software-read-FIFO mode or Hardware-read-FIFO mode.Once the trigger counter has started counting, any further triggers, either on TRIGIN or in the incoming trace stream, are ignored till the counter reaches 0. Once the counter has reached 0, it remains at 0 till it is re-programmed with a write to this register. This register is cleared when TMCReady goes HIGH, so that the state of the counter when trace capture has stopped does not affect a subsequent trace capture cycle.Attempting to write to this register while not in Disabled state (TMCReady=0 or TraceCaptEn=1) will result in Unpredictable behavior. A read access to this register is permitted even if trace capture enabled. A read access returns the current value of the Trigger counter. The width of this register and the Trigger counter depends on the size of the trace memory. In ETB and ETF configurations, the width of the counter is log2(MEMSIZE).

When trace capture is enabled, Formatter behavior is controlled by the FFCR register.When trace capture is disabled, any remaining data in the formatter is stored to RAM. If the TMC is programmed for Software-read-FIFO mode or hardware-read-FIFO mode and and TraceCaptEn is cleared before TMCReady=1, trace data may get corrupted. In the Hardware-read-FIFO mode, the unformatter drains any trace data in its internal pipelines on to the ATB Master interface, but discards any data that remains in the trace FIFO. Trace capture is fully disabled, or complete, when TMCReady goes HIGH. See Formatter and Flush Status Register, FFSR, 0x300.It is recommended that stopping trace capture be initiated only by programming stop conditions in FFCR register bits. Stopping trace capture by clearing TraceCaptEn is deprecated and is supported only for backwards compatibility with earlier versions of the ETB. Features in the TMC such as the DrainBuffer bit (FFCR register) and the Empty bit (STS register) that are not part of the earlier versions of the ETB do not support stopping trace capture by clearing TraceCaptEn. If trace capture stopping is initiated by clearing this bit, then the DrainBuffer feature (ETF configuration) cannot be invoked. Also, in the ETR configuration, if the TMC is programmed for Scatter_Gather operation and Circular-Buffer mode, clearing TraceCaptEn prevents reading trace data from memory.</td></tr>

When the EnFt bit is 0, no formatting information is inserted into the trace stream and the trace data is stored raw. When tracing is stopped, a byte of value 0x01 is appended to the trace buffer, followed by zero or more bytes of value 0x00 to align to a memory dataword. When data is later decompressed it is then possible to determine that a post-amble is present by back tracking the trailing zero data at the end of the trace stream until the last single bit at logic 1 is detected. All data preceding this first logic 1 is then treated as decompressible data. When all data has been stored in the RAM, FtStopped in the Formatter and Flush Status Register is set HIGH. Note: When the EnFt bit is 0, it is assumed that the source ID is not changing. Multiple flush generating conditions can be enabled together. However, if a second or third flush event is generated then the current flush completes before the next flush is serviced. Only one flush can be outstanding at a time. If two flushes are requested simultaneously, only one will be issued. If two flushes are requested while another is in progress, only one further flush will be issued when the in-progress flush completes.Multiple trigger indication conditions can be enabled simultaneously although this can cause the appearance of multiple triggers if flush using trigger is also enabled. If StopOnTrigEvt and FOnTrigEvt are both set then none of the flushed data is stored. When the system stops, it returns ATREADYS HIGH and does not store the accepted data packets. This is to stop stalling of any other devices connected using a Trace Replicator. StopOnTrigEvt, FOnTrigEvt and TrigOnTrigEvt bits are functional only in Circular Buffer mode. Setting these bits with the TMC enabled in FIFO modes will not have any effect on the TMC.Note: To perform a stop on flush completion through a manually-generated flush request, two write operations to the register are required - one to enable the stop event, if it is not already enabled and one to generate the manual flush.</td></tr>

For more information see the CoreSight Architecture Specification. This register enables the component to switch from a functional mode, the default behavior, to integration mode where the inputs and outputs of the component can be directly controlled for the purpose of integration testing and topology solving. Note: When a device has been in integration mode, it might not function with the original behavior. After performing integration or topology detection, you must reset the system to ensure correct behavior of CoreSight and other connected system components that are affected by the integration or topology detection.Writing to this register other than when in Disabled state (TMCReady=1 and TraceCaptEn=0) results in Unpredictable behavior.</td></tr>
