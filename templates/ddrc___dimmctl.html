Setting this bit ensures that, for mode register accesses generated by the DDRC during the automatic initialization routine and enabling of a particular DDR4 feature, separate A-side and B-side mode register accesses are generated. For B-side mode register accesses, these bits are inverted within the DDRC to compensate for this RDIMM inversion.<br/>Note: This has no effect on the address of any other memory accesses, or of software-driven mode register accesses.<br/>- 1 - Implement output inversion for B-side DRAMs.<br/>- 0 - Do not implement output inversion for B-side DRAMs.</td></tr>

Setting this bit ensures that, for mode register accesses during the automatic initialization routine, these bits are swapped within the DDRC to compensate for this UDIMM/RDIMM swapping. In addition to the automatic initialization routine, in case of DDR4 UDIMM/RDIMM, they are swapped during the automatic MRS access to enable/disable of a particular DDR4 feature.<br/>Note: This has no effect on the address of any other memory accesses, or of software-driven mode register accesses.<br/>This is not supported for LPDDR3 or LPDDR4 SDRAMs.<br/>Note: In case of x16 DDR4 DIMMs, BG1 output of MRS for the odd ranks is same as BG0 because BG1 is invalid, hence dimm_dis_bg_mirroring register must be set to 1.<br/>- 1 - For odd ranks, implement address mirroring for MRS commands to during initialization and for any automatic DDR4 MRS commands (to be used if UDIMM/RDIMM implements address mirroring)<br/>- 0 - Do not implement address mirroring</td></tr>
